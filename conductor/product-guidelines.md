# Product Guidelines

## Voice & Tone
*   **Cryptic & "Cursed":** The brand voice is mysterious, unsettling, and intentionally fragmented. It should feel like interacting with a system that is either extremely old, corrupted, or hiding something. Use clinical but "glitchy" language.

## Visual Identity
*   **Digital Decay (Primary):** Emphasize aging and corruption. Use CSS effects for film grain, dust, scratches, scanlines, and subtle glitches.
*   **Industrial Typography:** 
    *   **Body/Data:** Monospace (Courier) for a raw, database feel.
    *   **Headings:** Experimental grotesque fonts (e.g., `Terminal Grotesque`, `Overconsumption`) for high-impact display.
*   **Minimalist UI Chrome:** Avoid modern UI conventions (rounded corners, heavy shadows). Use raw text links, simple borders, and minimal "chrome" to keep the focus on the content and atmosphere.

## Layout & Interaction
*   **Experimental Structures:** Embrace "wrong" design choices like centered text walls, repeated punctuation (`~*~*`), and non-standard spacing to reinforce the "outsider" aesthetic.
*   **Low-Fi Interactivity:** 
    *   Trigger subtle glitches or hidden data reveals on hover.
    *   Use marquees and basic text animations instead of smooth, modern transitions.
*   **Adaptive Visuals:** Scale the intensity of these effects based on the user's device performance to ensure accessibility without sacrificing the core vibe.
