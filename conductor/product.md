# Initial Concept
A landing page for Paranormal Dynamics, Inc. with a "Cursed Database" / "Tech-Noir" vibe.

# Product Guide

## Target Users
*   **Creative Collaborators:** Directors, clients, and artists looking for a production partner with a distinct, edgy vision.

## Core Goals
1.  **Brand Expression:** Establish a strong, "cursed" industrial aesthetic that differentiates PDI from traditional production companies.
2.  **Portfolio Showcase:** Present projects as "case files" or "records" in an experimental, list-based format using mock data (Project A, B, C) to establish the structure.
3.  **Lead Generation (Secondary):** Provide a stylized but functional path for potential clients to make contact.

## Key Features
*   **Immersive Home Page:** High-impact landing page featuring "old film" effects, glitches, and raw text layouts.
*   **"Data List" Portfolio:** A dedicated Demo Reel/Work section presenting projects as a raw, industrial database list.
    *   *Implementation Note:* Will utilize mock projects (Project A, Project B, Project C) to build the UI structure in the absence of final assets.
*   **Interactive Elements:** "Cursed" interactions including marquees, hover-reveals, and "system status" indicators.

## Constraints & Technical Requirements
1.  **Static Hosting (Critical):** Must remain pure HTML/CSS (with minimal JS for effects) for seamless GitHub Pages deployment.
2.  **Performance:** Mobile-first and lightweight implementation.
3.  **Adaptive Performance:** Logic to scale the intensity of visual effects based on client device capabilities (e.g., reducing animations on low-power devices).
4.  **Asset Management:** Large media assets will be hosted externally. Placeholder/mock assets will be used during development.
